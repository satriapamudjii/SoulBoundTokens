SoulBoundTokens is a Flask-based server project designed to manage and verify digital tokens that represent unique, non-transferable assets or "soulbound" tokens. The project leverages Flask for server-side operations and SQLAlchemy for database interactions, particularly with a PostgreSQL database. It incorporates middleware for efficient JSON parsing, ensuring smooth communication between clients and the server. With routes specifically set up for token management and ownership verification, SoulBoundTokens aims to offer a structured platform for the secure handling of these unique digital assets. The server is configured to run on port 5000, providing an accessible endpoint for managing and interacting with soulbound tokens.
